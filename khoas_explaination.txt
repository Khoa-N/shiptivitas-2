In order to accomplish the desired tasks, we first calculate how much are initially in the status we wish to move our client to. We calculate it using the sqlite3 function .all(), and the .length property. We then process the request depending on two flags, whether the status is the same or different, and whether or not priority is given. Based on those flags we update the adjacent client's priorities, and update the requested client into the correct status and priority.
